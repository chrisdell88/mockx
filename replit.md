# DraftX Terminal — 2026 NFL Draft Stock Tracker

## Overview
Full-stack financial-market-style app that automatically scrapes 30+ analyst mock drafts daily, tracks ADP (Average Draft Position) changes over time, and visualizes player stock movement with a stock market UI.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + Vite, Wouter routing, TanStack Query, Recharts, Framer Motion, Shadcn/UI
- **Backend**: Express + TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL
- **Scrapers**: Cheerio + Axios for HTML scraping; node-cron for daily automation

## Database Schema (`shared/schema.ts`)
- `players` — 20 tracked prospects with combine data
- `analysts` — 41 sources with accuracy weights (Huddle Report data)
- `mockDrafts` — 8 mock drafts (DJ v1/v2/v3, GTM, MDDB, Walt 3/7, Charlie 3/9, Tankathon 3/14)
- `mockDraftPicks` — individual player picks per mock
